# lvalertMP
a place holder for lvalertMP functionality

I've dumped the important lvalertMP code in here to document it in a place that is not my laptop.

Note, this is not a "well formatted" package or anything, but just a place for me too back-up the code as it evolves.
The actual development will be done in a working copy of the lvalert repo, where I hope most of this will eventually reside.
